Python NE Word Counting Exercise
================================

This is the project created as part of the April 2014 meetup of Python North East. I wanted to make the code available to everyone who helped to make it so that they can review or make changes or whatever. 

The code currently reads in a file passed to it and will output the words and the frequency with which they appear - I am going to try pushing on with our attempts at finding the top 10 most common words and outputting these.
